# ZigFish


## TODO
- Prune moves that would cause the king to be in check/wouldn't get a king out of check
  - Maybe make board generate all valid moves at the start of the turn to do so?
- Use [bitset](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.bit_set.IntegerBitSet)s to track what squares are under attack
